/**
 * TelemetryProcessor – concurrent sensor-data pipeline
 *
 * Scenario: a fleet of devices continuously emits telemetry readings.
 * Each reading is represented as a {@link TelemetryEvent} carrying a device id,
 * a numeric metric value, and a nanosecond timestamp. Readings arrive faster than
 * they can be processed synchronously, so a multi-worker, queue-based pipeline
 * is required.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - submit(event) enqueues an event so a worker thread can process it.
 *   It must throw {@link IllegalArgumentException} if event is null.
 *   Events submitted before start() is called must be silently discarded.
 * - start(workerCount) spins up {@code workerCount} worker threads that continuously
 *   drain the queue and process events. It must throw {@link IllegalArgumentException}
 *   if workerCount ≤ 0. Calling start() a second time must be a no-op(should make no difference).
 * - stop() signals all workers to finish, waits for them to terminate, then processes
 *   any events still left in the queue before returning.
 * - getTotalProcessed() returns the running total of events fully processed.
 * - getStats() returns a {@link DoubleSummaryStatistics} snapshot of all processed
 *   metric values. Each call must return a fresh, independent object.
 *
 * Thread-safety requirements:
 * - submit() and the read methods (getTotalProcessed, getStats) may be called
 *   concurrently from multiple threads without data loss or corruption.
 * - Use java.util.concurrent building blocks. Do not use raw synchronized blocks.
